# BelgianNames
A list of belgian given and family names, scraped from www.rijksarchief.be


Scraping 1/5th of the website takes roughly a week and resulted in 406506 given names and 206668 family names... Important to note that all names stem from prior to 1912 and are thus somewhat archaic. A lot of the given names consists of multiple names (e.g. *marie catherine augustine*) of which the individual parts (by splitting on space) are still common today. Family names are timeless.
